procps (2:4.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * free: Used memory is Total - Available
    This means versions of free after 4.0.0 will show different Used
    values for older frees and some other system utilities.

procps (1:3.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * top has a new rcfile format from 3.3.1 which is not backwards compatible
    from a rcfile save from a pre-3.3.1 top.

procps (1:3.2.7-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * In this version I revert a long-standing (since potato I think) patch that
    incorrectly changed the time output for w for its Idle, PCPU and JCPU
    times. The patch should have only changed the times if the -o flag was
    used, instead of all the time. This is now fixed.
